Arrays 2

Now let's move on to another task. Here you are provided with a string to work with. We'd like you to:

1. Convert the string into an array, removing the + characters in the process. Save the result in a variable called myArray.
2. Store the length of the array in a variable called arrayLength.
3. Store the last item in the array in a variable called lastItem.
